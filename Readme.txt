PhD Retreat 2024: Workshop 
---
You need a working python version on your machine. 

1. Install the python package virtual env with 'pip install virtualenv' 
2. Create virtual environment with 'py -m venv .venv'
3. Activate virtual environment with 'source venv/bin/activate' (Linux) or '.\.venv\Scripts\activate' (Windows)
4. Install requirements in .venv with 'pip install -r requirements.txt' 
5. Test your setup with 'python scripts/test.py' (Ubuntu) or 'py scripts\test.py'

With this, you are prepared for Friday. See you soon,
