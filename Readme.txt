PhD Retreat 2024: Workshop 
---
This repository contains the code snippets required for the Hands-on sessions.  
You need a working python version on your machine. Moreover, the use of VSCode is recommended.

The following steps should help setting up a working python environment:
1. Install the python package virtual env with 'pip install virtualenv' 
2. Create virtual environment with 'py -m venv .venv'
3. Activate virtual environment with 'source venv/bin/activate' (Linux) or '.\.venv\Scripts\activate' (Windows)
4. Update your pip with 'py -m pip installieren --upgrade pip'
5. Install requirements in .venv with 'pip install -r requirements.txt' 
6. Open the 'test_me_before_friday.ipynb' file in your editor and run the code cells to test your system setup (see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)

See you on Friday!
