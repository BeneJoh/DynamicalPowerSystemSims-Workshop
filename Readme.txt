PhD Retreat 2024: Workshop 
---
This repository contains the code snippets required for the Hands-on sessions.  
You need a working python version on your machine. Moreover, the use of VSCode is recommended.

The following steps should help setting up a working python environment until Friday:
1. Install the python package virtual env with 'pip install virtualenv' 
2. Create virtual environment with 'py -m venv .venv'
3. Activate virtual environment with 'source venv/bin/activate' (Linux) or '.\.venv\Scripts\activate' (Windows)
4. Install requirements in .venv with 'pip install -r requirements.txt' 
5. Test your setup with 'python scripts/test_me_before_friday.py' (Ubuntu) or 'py scripts\test_me_before_friday.py'

See you on Friday!
